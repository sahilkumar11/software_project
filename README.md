 An Android application that provides the service to manage the credit of any small business or a person.
 Writing credit amounts in the diary or book is no more suitable in this digital world. As carrying a diary everywhere is not a good choice

 In CreditInfo the user can record the amount that he/she has to pay or has to take.
